              Ymir Fritz's Titan form was enormous in size with light hair, a
              feminine figure, and long protruding ribs. Her Titan's face
              possessed no apparent skin, musculature, or eyes, leaving only a
              skull visible. Ymir Fritz was the first individual to receive the
              power of the Titans, making her the true Founder of all Titans.[3]
              She used her powers to make great advancements for her subjects,
              such as cultivating barren lands, building roads across the world,
              and building bridges between the mountains.[54] After 13 years,
              she died, and her powers were split between the Nine Titans; her
              power as the Founding Titan would be passed down through the Fritz
              family (later the Reiss family) over the next two
              millennia.[3][55]

              the memories of the most of inhabitants. His pacifistic will
              passed down to his descendants that inherit the Founding Titan

              fur growing on his head, neck, and upper body. Like most Titans,

              have flesh and a beard. He had a bulkier body built. Unlike most
              Titan forms shown so far in the series, his body was very
              heavy-built. He used his Titan form to kill and devour Frieda
              Reiss along with most of her family,[57] gaining the Founding
              Titan. As he did not have royal blood, Grisha could not use the
              powers of the Founding Titan.

              chapel when she was 15 in order to receive his Titan abilities and
              secrets of the world.[58] She had the powers of the Founding
              Titan, but she died before she could learn how to fully use it.

              Zeke Yeager's Titan had a distinct, ape-like appearance. His
              Titan's body structure and facial features were like that of a
              human's, and he walked upright like one also. He stood at a
              previously unseen 17 m in height. Dark fur covered the large
              majority of his body, with the exception of his face, hands, feet,
              and torso. His arms were also elongated, almost reaching his
              ankles, with long fingers, hardened nails that he could use to
              crush rocks and parts of the Wall, and fully-functional thumbs.
              The proportions of his upper body were similar to that of the
              Colossus Titan, possessing a massive chest and small head, as well
              as unusually slim arms.[59] Zeke's Titan possessed massive
              strength and precision: he accurately hit members of the Survey
              Corps by hurling chunks of the Wall from far away, and destroyed
              an entire fleet of ships by throwing missiles into the sea.[60] He
              was also able to defeat the Armored Titan without any sustained
              damage.[61] It has been noted that the Beast Titan is the
              "strongest" Titan.[62] Furthermore, Zeke possessed the unique
              ability to create Pure Titans by screaming after administrating
              his spinal fluid into Subjects of Ymir; he had some control of
              these Titans and could even make them move at night.[63] Previous
              Beast Titans did not have this ability due to Zeke possessing
              royal blood from his mother, Dina Fritz.

              canine-like mouth, and nose were notably oversized in contrast

            <p>
              Bertolt's Titan was the first to appear chronologically within the
              series. As it was of a 60 m class, it was the tallest Titan of the
              Nine Titans seen so far, and the second largest Titan overall
              (coming second only to Rod Reiss' Titan, although it cannot
              stand); it is four times the height of the regular Titans of the
              tallest class (15 m). His Titan had incredible strength like no
              other, and was capable of breaking down Wall Maria's gate with a
              single kick. His Titan's body temperature was extremely high, to
              the point that it was constantly emitting steam. The heat of this
              steam was intense enough to keep dozens of experienced soldiers at
              bay, lest they be cooked alive.[64] However, because this Titan
              was so large, it could only move slowly. Bertolt’s Titan had no
              skin and swollen, pillar-like feet, unlike other Titans. When
              transforming, Bertolt had the potential to release an explosive
              amount of energy during Titan transformation, leveling buildings
              in a short radius of his transformation, and generating a
              mushroom-shaped cloud of steam.[

              Reiner Braun's Titan was a 15 m class with a slight resemblance to
              his human form. His Titan form had thick, hardened plates of skin
              all over his body which served as his armor. In addition to that,
              the Titan was able to further harden his arms and feet, and create
              sharp claws.[17] This Titan was well-built and has a hunched
              profile. Its only visible weaknesses were the small areas on the
              backs of its joints where there is no armor.[16] Though not
              particularly fast, this form was strong and agile, capable of
              destroying a fortified Wall after a sufficient running start.

              Annie Leonhart could transform into a 14 m class Titan with a
              distinctively feminine build and short, blonde hair. Her Titan had
              little skin, exposing her muscle tissues. Her transformation
              endowed her with immense strength and speed. A Titan of athletic
              appearance with lean muscle and minimal skin, Annie's was a Titan
              of unusual power and intellect. It had the stamina and focus to
              maintain a running pace capable of keeping up with horses over a
              long distance.[66] This Titan form also had the unique ability to
              harden its body parts by generating a crystalline substance across
              chosen areas of its body, allowing it to simultaneously protect
              its nape and fight.[67] Combined with Annie's refined martial
              arts, it could perform incredibly deadly and destructive attacks.
              The Female Titan could call upon nearby Pure Titans by
              screaming,[68] drawing them towards the vicinity of the Female
              Titan's current location.

              Ymir's Titan was a 5 m class Titan with long, black hair, very

              Ymir rather long arms and sharp claws and provided her with great
              agility. Ymir's Titan had a mouth with all pointed teeth, as well

              for combat. Its long arms and small, muscular body enabled it to

              environments as those with vertical maneuvering equipment, making
              it a formidable foe in battle.[69] Unlike the others who gained
              their powers under a controlled process, Ymir gained her powers
              unexpectedly by eating Marcel while roaming Paradis Island.

              Eren Yeager's initial Titan is a 15 m class, which he received
              after devouring his father. Its most prominent characteristics
              were its elongated ears, fleshless jaws, and highly muscular
              build. Eren's Titan form had so far been shown to have fairly
              substantial physical strength and endurance. After ingesting a
              bottle labeled "Armor" from Rod Reiss's bag, Eren's Titan gained
              the ability to harden, allowing him to seal the hole in Wall
              Maria.[51] Prolonged and repeated use of this Titan form had
              allowed Eren to gradually increase control over its initially
              unstable mental state. Its eyes were a piercing gray. Initially
              due to not having royal blood, Eren was unable to use the powers
              of the Founding Titan. However, if he came in contact with a Titan
              with royal blood, such as Dina Fritz, he could temporarily use its
              abilities like controlling Pure Titans with his screams.[70]
              During the Raid on Liberio, Eren killed and consumed Lara Tybur,
              inheriting her War Hammer Titan and gaining structural hardening
              abilities, which he went on to use against both the Armored Titan
              and Jaw Titan.[71] After coming into contact with his half-brother
              Zeke, Eren was able to obtain the full capabilities of the
              Founding Titan, such as controlling the Colossus Titans within the
              Walls. His Founding Titan was massive, towering over the Colossus
              Titans by a large scale. This form is known as Doomsday Titan
              (終尾の巨人 Shūbi no Kyojin?).

              Lara Tybur's Titan form was around 15 m. Her Titan had no hair and
              her skin jailed the exposed areas near her eyes and mouth. She was
              capable of hardening her Titan form into various weapons and
              structures.[26] She was skilled with the hammer and was able to
              defeat Eren Yeager with a single blow from it. Unlike the other
              intelligent Titans, she controlled her Titan from far away instead
              of from inside the nape, with her human body, encased in hardened
              flesh, stayed connected to her Titan body by a kind of "flesh
              cord.

              Armin Arlert gained the power of the Titans by eating Bertolt
              Hoover after Levi injected him with a Titan serum obtained from
              Kenny Ackerman in Battle of Shiganshina District. His Titan was
              similar in size to Bertolt's Colossus Titan, though with a more
              gaunt body and having unique features such as the ribs being
              exposed and having the windpipe visible along with two tendons
              stretching from the Titan's neck. Armin's Titan possessed the same
              abilities as his predecessor's Titan including a destructive
              transformation, as seen during the Raid on Liberio when the
              Colossus Titan destroyed the naval port and used its enhanced
              strength to crush the ships to ensure their destruction

              Porco Galliard received his Titan from Ymir, after she decided to

              the jawline was hairless, and his Titan's mouth took a cog-like
              appearance in place of lips or cheeks. The fingers of Galliard's
              Titan possessed segments of hardened skin.
